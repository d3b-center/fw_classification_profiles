# Flywheel file classification profiles

Each image uploaded to our Flywheel instance gets automatically classified by the [file-classifier gear](https://gitlab.com/flywheel-io/scientific-solutions/lib/fw-classification), which primarily relies on the DICOM SeriesDescription tag for a given image.

Default profiles provided by Flywheel can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/flywheel-io/scientific-solutions/lib/fw-classification-profiles).
